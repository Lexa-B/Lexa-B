- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lexa-B
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D printing, especially bioprinting of volumetric organs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidworks, Typescript, C, & LabVIEW.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on anything related to biomedical engineering or 3D printing, especially via YouTube.
- 📫 You can shoot me a comment or a DM on my YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC49ev543BdNjZqR5LVoJBYQ.  I might be slow to reply though as I'm really busy between work, classes, and research.
