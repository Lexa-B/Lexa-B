- 👋 Hi, I’m Lexa!
- 🇯🇵 I'm an AI reserch intern at Sakana AI in Tokyo
- 👀 I’m obsessed with AI, Especially GenAI and ML and how internal world models form... but I also love Tissue Engineering and 3D bioprinting.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching exciting new forms of GenAI... check back for more later.
- 🤖 My GenAI development background focused on Large Concept Models (LCMs), which are a modality of language-agnostic AI that operate in a higher-abstraction concept space, as opposed to the concretion (low abstraction) focus of token(roughly word)-based token prediction employed by LLMs.
