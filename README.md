- 👋 Hi, I’m Lexa!
- 🇯🇵 I'm in the process of looking for a Job in Japan that will sponsor my Highly Skilled Professionals' Visa... so please let me know if you know any recruiters!! 
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Tissue Engineering, and 3D bioprinting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GenAI development, specically LangChain-based RAG-capable agents. My current project is an LLM inference-generated mathematical representation of the complex web of emotionality that occurs in conversation.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on anything related to AI!!
