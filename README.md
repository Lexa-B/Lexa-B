- 👋 Hi, I’m Lexa!
- 🇯🇵 I'm in the process of looking for a Job in Japan that will sponsor my Highly Skilled Professionals' Visa... so please let me know if you know any recruiters!! 
- 👀 I’m interested in AI, Tissue Engineering, and 3D bioprinting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning GenAI development, specifically focusing on Large Concept Models, which which are a modality of language-agnostic AI that operate in a higher-abstraction concept space, as opposed to the higher concrerion of word-based methods employed by LLMs.
- 🧠 I'm also interested in LangChain-based RAG-capable agents. My long-term project is an LLM inference-generated mathematical representation of the complex web of emotionality that occurs in conversations between all participants.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on anything related to AI, 3D bioprinting, or Tissue Engineering!!
